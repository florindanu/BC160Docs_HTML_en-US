<p>If the period includes a credit memo, a message appears, and if you choose the <strong>OK</strong> button, the <strong>Customer/Vendor Warnings 349</strong> page opens and shows all credit memos for that period.</p>
<p>Entries related to credit memos display on the <strong>Customer/Vendor Warnings 349</strong> page because you may want to include them as corrections to invoices. For example, if you posted a sales invoice in October, and you then post a credit memo in November that corrects the October invoice, a warning displays. Then, you can make the appropriate changes on the <strong>Customer/Vendor Warnings 349</strong> page. You must specify which section of the total amount for that customer must be included in the November 349 declaration.</p>

</li>
<li><p>When you have made the appropriate changes, choose the <strong>Process</strong> action.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>For corrections to amounts that were included in an earlier 349 declaration, the page can show more than one warning for a customer or vendor with the same values in the <strong>Original Declaration FY</strong> and <strong>Original Declaration Period</strong> fields. In that case, you should combine the corrections in a single line so that the appropriate amounts for the <strong>Previous Declared Amount</strong> field and the <strong>Original Declared Amount</strong> field are included in the 349 declaration.</p>
