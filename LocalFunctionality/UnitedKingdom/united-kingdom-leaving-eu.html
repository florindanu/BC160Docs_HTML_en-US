<h1 id="preparing-for-the-united-kingdom-to-leave-the-european-union">Preparing for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union</h1>

<p>The departure of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU), will undoubtedly impact many businesses operating inside and across UK borders. At the moment, we do not foresee any required Microsoft Business Central product changes when the United Kingdom leaves EU. However, as a user of Business Central, your organization should expect to make configuration changes. Business Central is a highly configurable business application and has many settings related to VAT processes, which is the area that will most likely be impacted. You may want to start preparing for changes in legislation, such as keeping track of VAT rules. Assuming the United Kingdom leaves the EU, we recommend that you pay specific attention to the potential VAT impact around the exit date, making sure to fully post open documents before changing your VAT setup. Please engage your Business Central reselling partner for assistance.</p>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>I’m using the online version of Business Central – where is my data stored?</strong></p>
<p>The data for UK customers of Business Central online is stored in data centers in the United Kingdom. This will not change, regardless of whether the United Kingdom leaves the EU. If you create another Business Central environment in the same tenant, and choose another country for this environment, the data will be stored in data centers that serve that specific country. In most cases, those data centers are outside the United Kingdom. This is to ensure optimal data residency and performance.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Does Business Central support legislation in the United Kingdom?</strong></p>
<p>In many cases, yes. As with all countries for which Microsoft provides a localized version, we follow the impact of local and EU-wide legislation and evaluate how we can support our customers. The responsibility for compliance rests on the individual business in a country, but we provide tools and features that can help our customers meet regulatory requirements, within the confines of our product strategy. A good example of that is our feature for Making Tax Digital, which makes VAT reporting easier and fully digital. There are, however, cases where regulations may require additional feature support. For example, when regulations impact a specific vertical industry, such as construction, we expect the solution that extends Business Central for that industry by a Microsoft Independent Software Vendor (ISV) to provide the necessary features for the regulatory requirements specific to that vertical. Again, the responsibility for compliance rests with the individual business deploying the solution.</p>
