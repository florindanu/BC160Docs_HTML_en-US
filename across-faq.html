<h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>This section contains answers to frequently asked questions about signing up for a trial, buying a subscription, and using Business Central. You can also learn how to get technical support.</p>
<h2 id="is--available-in-my-country">Is Business Central available in my country?</h2>
<p>Business Central is available in a limited number of markets, but new countries are added through Microsoft-led localization or through partner-led localization on a quarterly basis. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/compliance/apptest-countries-and-translations?toc=/dynamics365/business-central/toc.json">Country/Regional Availability and Supported Translations</a> (available in English only).</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-get-">How do I get Business Central?</h2>
<p>You can sign up for a free trial to explore Business Central. Start a <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=847861">free trial!</a> If you want more time to explore, <a href="#can-i-extend-my-30-day-new-company-trial-period">you can extend your trial period</a>.</p>
<p>To help you get ready for doing business in Business Central, you can launch assisted setup guides, videos, or help topics for selected setup tasks. For more information, see <a href="ui-get-ready-business.html">Getting Ready for Doing Business</a>.</p>
<p>When you are ready to buy Business Central, you can find a Business Central partner on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2038145">I'm looking for a solution provider</a> page. For more information, see <a href="#findpartner">How do I find a reselling partner?</a>.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-i-go-if-i-have-questions">Where do I go if I have questions?</h2>
<p>If you have questions about Business Central that you can't find an answer for in this documentation, you can ask the Business Central community. For more information, see <a href="https://community.dynamics.com/business">Dynamics 365 Business Central community</a>.</p>
<p>From the community home page, you can also find links to our blogs where you can also find tips and tricks. For more information, see <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/it/product/business-central/">Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central on the Dynamics 365 blog</a> and the older <a href="https://community.dynamics.com/business/b/financials">Dynamics 365 Business Central Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, you can contact your Business Central reselling partner. For more information, see the <a href="across-faq.html#hdigetsupport">How do I get technical support?</a> and <a href="#findpartner">How do I find a reselling partner?</a> sections.</p>
<h2 id="why-cant-i-find-that-capability-in-my-">Why can't I find that capability in my Business Central?</h2>
<p>Did you read about a new capability in the release plan or on our blog recently? In that case, your Business Central might not have been upgraded to the latest version yet. You can check which version your Business Central is based on in the <a href="product-help-and-support.html">Help and Support</a> page.</p>
<p>Also, if the capability is published as an extension in AppSource, then there is a delay between the extension being announced and its availability in AppSource.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-any-differences-between-an-on-premises-deployment-and-the-cloud-version-of-business-central">Are there any differences between an on-premises deployment and the cloud version of Business Central?</h2>
<p>Yes. Some Cloud-based features may run on premises in certain cases and others are not supported at all. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/features-not-implemented-on-premises">Features not implemented in on-premises deployments of Dynamics 365 Business Central</a>.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-get-training-in-">Can I get training in Business Central?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can! You can find free eLearning content on the <a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/learn/browse/?products=dynamics-business-central">Microsoft Learn site</a>. For more information, see <a href="readiness/readiness-learning-catalog.html">Business Central Learning Catalog</a>. You can also ask your reselling partner for additional training. If you don't know who that is, see the <a href="#findpartner">How do I find a reselling partner?</a> section.</p>
<p>For more information about training across Dynamics 365 that is provided by Microsoft, see the <a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/get-started/training/index#dynamics-365-customers">Microsoft Dynamics 365 training</a> page.</p>
<p>Additional content is provided by the Business Central community, such as the <a href="https://leanpub.com/dynamics">Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central Field Guide</a> that is written by a partner.</p>
<h2 id="hdigetsupport">How do I get technical support for Business Central?</h2>
<p>Business Central is sold through partners, and you should contact your reselling partner to get help with technical problems. If your Business Central partner then cannot resolve the problem, they will raise a support ticket with Microsoft.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a href="product-help-and-support.html">Help and Support</a> and the <a href="#findpartner">How do I find a reselling partner?</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-help-describe-functionality-that-i-cannot-access">Why does Help describe functionality that I cannot access?</h2>
<p>If your Experience setting on the <strong>Company Information</strong> page is set to <strong>Essential</strong>, then UI elements for the Manufacturing and Service Management features are not visible to you because they require the <strong>Premium</strong> experience. A text note is inserted in high-level help topics for these feature areas. For more information, see <a href="ui-experiences.html">Change Which Features are Displayed</a>.</p>
<h2 id="where-is-the-save-button">Where is the save button?</h2>
<p>There is no <em>save</em> button on pages like in other programs that you might be familiar with. In Business Central, changes that you make to a field are automatically saved as soon as you move to the next field or close the page, as long as there are no errors. When you make changes to a field and move to another field, you will see the text <strong>Saving</strong> in the top-right corner of the page, which will quickly change to <strong>Saved</strong> if no errors occur. If an error occurs, the text will change to <strong>Not Saved</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="email">What email address can I use with Business Central?</h2>
<p>Business Central requires that you use a work, or school, email address to sign up. Business Central does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunication providers. This includes outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and others.</p>
<p>If you try to sign up with a personal email address, you will get a message indicating to use a work or school email address. For more information, see <a href="ui-troubleshoot-self-signup.html">Troubleshooting Self-Service Sign-Up</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to deploy Business Central on-premises, then you can use other authentication methods. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/deployment">Deployment of Dynamics 365 Business Central</a>.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-have-to-buy-office-365">Do I have to buy Office 365?</h2>
<p>No. But if you want to experience Business Central as fully integrated with Office 365, you can sign up for a 1-month free trial of Office 365 <a href="https://products.office.com/try">here</a>.</p>
<p>If the account you sign up with is a non-Office 365 work account (such as joe@mysolution.com), and you have an Office 365 subscription, then you can associate your domain (<em>mysolution.com</em>) with the Office 365 subscription. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/get-help-with-domains?view=o365-worldwide">Get help with Office 365 domains</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not have an Office 365 subscription, and you do not want to buy one, then, when you sign up, we provision a new Azure Active Directory tenant for you so that you have access to the Azure portal where you have access to advanced administration tools.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-integration-with-office-365-about">What is the integration with Office 365 about?</h2>
<p>Business Central online is fully integrated with Office 365 so that you can navigate freely between Office 365 apps and Business Central using the app launcher. In Business Central, you can open data in Excel, print reports using Word, and you can work with your Business Central data in Outlook, for example. For more information, see <a href="admin-outlook.html">Using Business Central as your Business Inbox in Outlook</a>.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-extend-my-30-day-new-company-trial-period">Can I extend my 30-day &quot;New Company&quot; trial period?</h2>
<p>Yes. When the expiration date for your trial period is approaching we will display a notification to alert you when you sign in. The notification contains a link to the <strong>Extend Trial Period</strong> guide that you can use to extend your trial period. The extra 30 days start the moment you choose <strong>Extend Trial</strong> in the guide. You can extend the trial period one time yourself. After that, a Microsoft partner can extend it for another 30 days. For more information, see <a href="admin-extend-trial.html">Extend Your Trial Version</a>.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>It may take up to two business days to complete the trial extension process.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="our-administrator-has-moved-me-to-another-plan-to-give-me-another-role-but-i-still-see-the-same-home-screen-in-">Our administrator has moved me to another plan to give me another role, but I still see the same Home screen in Business Central?</h2>
<p>This is a bit complicated, but it looks like your administrator didn't change your assigned role and assign user groups that match the new license. Essentially, your access to Business Central is determined by the type of plan (license) that you have - this sets permissions, your assigned role and your default Home screen. You can change your current role manually in My Settings, but if you are moved to another plan, such as moving you from the Business plan to the Team Members plan, you might see the old Home screen because your permissions were not changed.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-cancel-my-subscription">Can I cancel my subscription?</h2>
<p>Yes, but depending on how you signed up to Business Central, your data can be deleted or preserved. For more information, see <a href="admin-cancel.html">Canceling Business Central</a>.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-use-multi-factor-authentication">Can I use multi-factor authentication?</h2>
<p>Sure. If you do, you might need an app password in order to send email messages. App passwords give an app or a device access to your email account. The steps for getting an app password vary, depending on your email provider. For more information, see the help from your provider. For example, if you're using Outlook, see <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2082543">Create an app password for Office 365</a>.</p>
<h2 id="findpartner">How do I find a reselling partner?</h2>
<p>Business Central is sold and implemented through a global network of Dynamics 365 partners with industry expertise. Contact a partner for a detailed assessment, consulting services, and additional pricing. For more information, see the <strong>Pricing</strong> section on the <a href="https://dynamics.microsoft.com/business-central/overview/">Dynamics 365 Business Central page on microsoft.com</a>.</p>
<p>When you are ready to buy Business Central, you can find a Business Central partner on the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2038145">I'm looking for a solution provider</a> page. You can also find solutions and services from partners in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=845998">Microsoft AppSource</a>.</p>
<p>If you want guidance from Microsoft, contact the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828707">Microsoft Sales team</a>.</p>
<p>Your reselling partner will also handle technical support for you. For more information, see <a href="product-help-and-support.html">Resources for Help and Support</a>.</p>
<h2 id="is-the-windows-client-supported">Is the Windows client supported?</h2>
<p>The first releases of Business Central on premises included an installed client derived from Microsoft Dynamics NAV. Starting with 2019 release wave 2, this legacy component, referred to as &quot;the Windows client&quot;, will no longer be available for Business Central. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/faq-win-cli">FAQ About the Windows Client and Business Central</a>.</p>
