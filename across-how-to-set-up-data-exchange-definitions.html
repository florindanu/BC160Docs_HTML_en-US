<p>You can set up Business Central to exchange data in specific tables with data on external files, for example to send and receive electronic documents, import and export bank data or other data, such as payroll, currency exchange rates, and item catalogues. For more information, see <a href="across-data-exchange.html">Exchanging Data Electronically</a>.</p>
<p>As preparation for creating a data exchange definition for a data file or stream, you can use the related XML schema to define which data elements to include on the <strong>Column Definitions</strong> FastTab. See step 6 in <a href="across-how-to-set-up-data-exchange-definitions.html#to-describe-the-formatting-of-lines-and-columns-in-the-file">To describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file</a>. For more information, see the <a href="across-how-to-use-xml-schemas-to-prepare-data-exchange-definitions.html">Use XML Schemas to Prepare Data Exchange Definitions</a>.</p>
<p>You normally set up data exchange definitions on the <strong>Data Exchange Definition</strong> page. However, when you set up a data exchange definition for the service of refreshing currency exchange rates, you start the process in the simplified <strong>Exch. Rate Update Setup Card</strong> page.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If the file that is being converted is in XML format, the term <em>“column”</em> in this topic should be interpreted as <em>“XML element containing data”</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>This topic includes the following procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>To create a data exchange definition</li>
<li>To export a data exchange definition as an XML file for use by others</li>
<li>To import an XML file for an existing data exchange definition</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="to-create-a-data-exchange-definition">To create a data exchange definition</h2>
<p>Creating a data exchange definition involves two tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Data Exchange Definition</strong> page, describe the formatting of lines and columns in the file.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Data Exchange Mapping</strong> page, map columns in the data file to fields in Business Central.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is described in the following procedures.</p>
<div class="TIP">

<p>To see which codeunits Microsoft uses in existing definitions in the standard product, review the three <strong>Codeunit</strong> fields on the header of the <strong>Field Mapping</strong> page for each definition.</p>

<li><p>Repeat step 8 for every column or XML element in the data file that has data that you want to exchange with Business Central.</p>

</ol>
<p>The next step in creating a data exchange definition is to decide which columns or XML elements in the data file map to which fields in Business Central.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The specific mapping depends on the business purpose of the data file to be exchanged and on local variations. Even the SEPA bank standard has local variations. Business Central supports import of SEPA CAMT bank statement files out-of-the-box. This is represented by the <strong>SEPA CAMT</strong> data exchange definition record code on the <strong>Data Exchange Definitions</strong> page. For information about the specific field mapping of this SEPA CAMT support, see <a href="across-field-mapping-when-importing-sepa-camt-files.html">Field Mapping When Importing SEPA CAMT Files</a>.</p>

<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>Sometimes the values in the fields that you want to map are different. For example, in one business app the language code for the United States is &quot;U.S.,&quot;
but in the other it's &quot;US.&quot; That means you must transform the value when you exchange data. This happens through transformation rules that you define for the fields.

<h3 id="transformation-rules">Transformation Rules</h3>
<p>If the values in the fields you are mapping differ, you must use transformation rules for data exchange definitions to make them the same. You define transformation rules for data exchange definitions by opening an existing definition, or creating a new definition, and then on the <strong>Line Definitions</strong> FastTab, choosing <strong>Manage</strong>, and then <strong>Field Mapping</strong>. Predefined rules are provided, but you can also create your own. The following table describes the types of transformations that you can perform.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Option</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Uppercase</strong></td>
<td>Capitalize all letters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Lowercase</strong></td>
<td>Make all letters lowercase.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Title Case</strong></td>
<td>Capitalize the first letter of each word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Trim</strong></td>
<td>Remove empty spaces before and after the value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Substring</strong></td>
<td>Transform a specific portion of a value. To specify where to start the transformation, choose either a <strong>Start Position</strong> or <strong>Starting Text</strong>. The starting position is a number that represents the first character to transform. The starting text is the letter immediately before the letter to replace. If you want to start with the first letter in the value, use a starting position instead. To specify where to stop the transformation you choose either <strong>Length</strong>, which is the number of characters to replace, or the <strong>Ending Text</strong>, which is the character that is immediately after the last character to transform.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Replace</strong></td>
<td>Find a value and replace it with another. This is useful for replacing simple values, such as a particular word.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Regular Expression - Replace</strong></td>
<td>Use a regular expression as part of a find and replace operation. This is useful for replacing multiple, or perhaps more complex, values.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Remove Non-Alphanumeric Characters</strong></td>
<td>Delete characters that are not letters or numbers, such as symbols or special characters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Date Formatting</strong></td>
<td>Specify how to display dates. For example, you can transform DD-MM-YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Decimal Formatting</strong></td>
<td>Define rules for decimal placement and rounding precision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Regular Expression - Match</strong></td>
<td>Use a regular expression to find one or more values. This is similar to the <strong>Substring</strong> and <strong>Regular Expression - Replace</strong> options.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Custom</strong></td>
<td>This is an advanced option that requires assistance from a developer. It enables an integration event that that you can subscribe to if you want to use your own transformation code. If you are a developer and want to use this option, see the &quot;Tip for Developers: Example of the Custom Option&quot; section below.</td>

<h4 id="tip-for-developers-example-of-the-custom-option">Tip for Developers: Example of the Custom Option</h4>
<p>The following example shows how to implement your own transformation code.</p>
<pre><code>codeunit 60100 &quot;Hello World&quot;

        if TransformationCode = 'CUST' then
            OutputText := InputText + ' testing';

<li><p>Choose the <strong>Export Data Exchange Definition</strong> action.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Save the XML file that represents the data exchange definition in an appropriate location.</p>
<p>If a data exchange definition has already been created, you just have to import the XML file into the Data Exchange Framework. This is described in the following procedure.</p>
