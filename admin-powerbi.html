<p>Getting insights into your Business Central data is easy with the Business Central apps for Power BI. Power BI retrieves your data and then builds an out-of-the-box dashboard and reports based on that data.</p>
<p>You must have a valid account with Business Central and with Power BI. Also, you must download <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/">Power BI Desktop</a> if you wish to create your own Power BI reports. Power BI apps require permissions to the tables where data is retrieved from. More details on the requirements are described below.</p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>The Power BI Apps that are described in this article are designed to use Azure Active Directory as the authentication mechanism unless otherwise specified. Also, you need a <a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-features-license-type">Power BI Pro license</a> to share your content, and the people you share it with do too, or the content must be in a workspace in a <a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-premium-what-is">Premium capacity</a>. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports">Ways to share your work in Power BI</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Dynamics 365 Business Central has published the following apps for Power BI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamics 365 Business Central - CRM</li>
<li>Dynamics 365 Business Central - Finance</li>
<li>Dynamics 365 Business Central - Sales</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-the--dashboards-in-power-bi">Using the Business Central dashboards in Power BI</h2>
<p>Each app provides reports that you can drill into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose any visual on the dashboard to bring up one of the underlying reports.</li>
<li>Filter the report or add fields that you want to monitor.</li>
<li>Pin this customized view to the dashboard to continue tracking.<br>
You can refresh data manually, and you can set up a refresh schedule. For more information, see <a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/refresh-scheduled-refresh">Configuring scheduled refresh</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The apps are designed to work with data from any company that you have in your Business Central. When you install the Power BI app, you specify one or more parameters to connect to your Business Central.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>

<h3 id="selecting-power-bi-reports">Selecting Power BI reports</h3>
<p>The Power BI control on your Home page can display any Power BI report. To view an existing report, choose the <strong>Select Report</strong> action from the Power BI drop down command list.</p>

<li>You have not entered a valid user name or password.</li>
</ul>
