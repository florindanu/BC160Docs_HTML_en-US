<h1 id="integrating-with-dynamics-365-sales">Integrating with Dynamics 365 Sales</h1>

<p>The sales person role is often considered as one the most outward-facing jobs in a business. However, it can be helpful for sales people to be able to look inward in the business and see what is happening on the back end. By integrating Business Central and Dynamics 365 Sales, you can give your sales people that insight by enabling them to view information in Business Central while they are working in Dynamics 365 Sales. For example, when preparing a sales quote it could be useful to know whether you have enough inventory to fulfill the order. For more information, see <a href="marketing-integrate-dynamicscrm.html">Using Dynamics 365 Sales from Business Central</a>.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>This topic describes the process of integrating the online versions of Dynamics 365 Sales and Business Central through Common Data Service. For information about on-premises configuration, see <a href="/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/prepare-dynamics-365-for-sales-for-integration.md">Preparing Dynamics 365 Sales for Integration on-premises</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="integrating-through-common-data-service">Integrating Through Common Data Service</h2>
<p>Business Central also integrates with Common Data Service, which makes it easy to connect and synchronize data with other Dynamics 365 applications, such as Dynamics 365 Sales, or even apps that you build yourself. If you are integrating for the first time, we recommend that you do so through Common Data Service. For more information, see <a href="admin-common-data-service.html">Integration with Common Data Service</a>.</p>
<p>If you have already integrated Dynamics 365 Sales with Business Central, you can continue to synchronize data using your setup. However, if you upgrade or turn off your Dynamics 365 Sales integration, to turn it on again you must connect through Common Data Service. For more information, see <a href="admin-upgrade-sales-to-cds.html">Upgrading an Integration with Dynamics 365 Sales</a>.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Reconnecting through Common Data Service will apply default synchronization settings, and will overwrite any configurations you have. For example, the default table mappings will be applied.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="integration-settings-that-are-specific-to-a--integration">Integration Settings that are Specific to a Dynamics 365 Sales Integration</h2>
<p>Integration with Business Central happens through Common Data Service, and there are a lot of standard settings and entities that are provided by the integration. In addition to the standard settings, there are some that are specific to Dynamics 365 Sales. The following sections list those.</p>
<h2 id="permissions-and-security-roles-for-user-accounts-in-sales">Permissions and Security Roles for User Accounts in Sales</h2>
<p>When you install the Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured. If those permissions are changed you might need to reset them. You can do that by reinstalling the Integration Solution by choosing <strong>Redeploy Integration Solution</strong> on the <strong>Dynamics 365 Connection Setup</strong> page. The following security roles are deployed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration Administrator</li>
<li>Dynamics 365 Business Central Integration User</li>
<li>Dynamics 365 Business Central Product Availability User</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="connection-settings-in-the-setup-guide">Connection Settings in the Setup Guide</h3>
<p>You can use an assisted setup guide to quickly set up the connection and specify advanced features, such as coupling between records.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose <strong>Setup and Extensions</strong>, and then choose <strong>Assisted Setup</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Set up the Dynamics 365 Sales Connection</strong> to start the assisted setup guide.</li>
<li>Fill in the fields as necessary.</li>
<li>Optionally, there are advanced settings that can enhance security and enable additional capabilities, such as sales order processing and viewing inventory levels. The following table describes the advanced settings.</li>

### User Account Settings
Integrate with Business Central through Common Data Service requires an administrator user account and an account that is used only for the connection between the apps. This account is called the "integration user." When you install the CDS Base Integration Solution, permissions for the integration user account are configured in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)]. If those permissions are changed you might need to reset them. You can do that by reinstalling the Integration Solution or by manually resetting them. The following tables list the minimum permissions for the user accounts in [!INCLUDE[crm_md](includes/crm_md.md)].  -->
<h3 id="standard-sales-entity-mapping-for-synchronization">Standard Sales Entity Mapping for Synchronization</h3>
<p>Entities in Dynamics 365 Sales, such as orders, are integrated with equivalent types of entities in Business Central,such as sales orders. To work with Dynamics 365 Sales data you set up links, called couplings, between entities in Business Central and Dynamics 365 Sales.</p>

<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Changes to data in  that were made by the integration user account are not synchronized. Therefore, we recommended that you do not change data while using that account.

<td>Posted Sales Invoices</td>
<td>Posted sales invoices are synchronized with sales invoices. Before an invoice can be synchronized, it is better to synchronize all other entities that can participate in the invoice, from salespersons to price lists. The Salesperson Code value in the invoice header defines the owner of the coupled entity in Sales.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sales Orders</td>
<td>When sales order integration is enabled, sales orders in Business Central that are created from submitted sales orders in Dynamics 365 Sales are synchronized with sales orders in INCLUDE SALES when they are released. Before you synchronize orders, we recommend that you first synchronize all entities that the are involved with the order, such as sales persons and price lists. The Salesperson Code field in the order header defines the owner of the coupled entity in Dynamics 365 Sales.</td>
