<h1 id="reconcile-bank-accounts">Reconcile Bank Accounts</h1>

<p>You perform bank reconciliation to make sure that your various business transactions and expenses are reflected correctly in the company books. You do this by comparing and matching entries in your internal bank accounts with bank transactions at your bank, and then posting the balances to your internal bank accounts to make totals available to finance managers. Bank reconciliation is also a practical way to discover and resolve missing payments and bookkeeping errors.</p>
<p>The following describes how to perform bank reconciliation with the <strong>Bank Acc. Reconciliation</strong> page.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>You can also reconcile bank accounts on the <strong>Payment Reconciliation Journal</strong> page in connection with payment processing. Any open bank account ledger entries related to the applied customer or vendor ledger entries will be closed when you choose the <strong>Post Payments and Reconcile Bank Account</strong> action. This means that the bank account is automatically reconciled for payments that you post with the journal. For more information, see <a href="receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.html">Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>In North American versions, you can also perform this work on the <strong>Bank Rec. Worksheet</strong> page, which is better suited for checks and deposits but does not offer import of bank statement files. To use this page instead of the <strong>Bank Acc. Reconciliation</strong> page, deselect the <strong>Bank Recon. with Auto. Match</strong> field on the <strong>General Ledger Setup</strong> page. For more information, see the &quot;Reconcile Bank Accounts&quot; section under United States Local Functionality.</p>
</div>
<p>The lines on the <strong>Bank Acc. Reconciliation</strong> page are divided into two panes. The <strong>Bank Statement Lines</strong> pane shows either imported bank transactions or ledger entries with outstanding payments. The <strong>Bank Account Ledger Entries</strong> pane shows the ledger entries in the internal bank account.</p>
<p>The activity of reconciling bank transactions with internal bank entries is referred to as <em>matching</em>. You can choose to perform matching automatically by using the <strong>Match Automatically</strong> function. Alternatively, you can manually select lines in both panes to link each bank statement line to one or more related bank account ledger entries, and then use the <strong>Match Manually</strong> function. The <strong>Applied</strong> checkbox is selected on lines where entries match. For more information, see <a href="receivables-how-set-up-payment-application-rules.html">Set Up Rules for Automatic Application of Payments</a>.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If bank statement lines relate to check ledger entries, you cannot use the matching functions. Instead, you must choose the <strong>Apply Entries</strong> action, and then select the relevant check ledger entry to match the bank statement line with.</p>
</div>
<p>When the value in the <strong>Total Balance</strong> field in the <strong>Bank Statement Lines</strong> pane equals the value in the <strong>Balance To Reconcile</strong> field in the <strong>Bank Account Ledger Entries</strong> pane, you can choose the <strong>Post</strong> action. Any non-matched bank account ledger entries will remain on the page, indicating some discrepancy that you should resolve to reconcile the bank account.</p>
<p>Any lines that cannot be matched, indicated by a value in the <strong>Difference</strong> field, will remain on the <strong>Bank Acc. Reconciliation</strong> page after posting. They represent some kind of discrepancy that you must resolve before you can complete the bank account reconciliation. Typical business situations that may cause differences:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Difference</th>
<th>Reason</th>
<th>Resolution</th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A transaction in the internal bank account is not on the bank statement.</td>
<td>The bank transaction did not occur although a posting was made in Business Central.</td>
<td>Make the missing money transaction (or prompt a debitor to make it), and then reimport the bank statement file or enter the transaction manually.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A transaction on the bank statement does not exist as a document or journal line in Business Central.</td>
<td>A bank transaction was made without a corresponding posting in Business Central, for example a journal line posting for an expense.</td>
<td>Create and post the missing entry. For information on a quick way to initiate this, see <a href="bank-how-reconcile-bank-accounts-separately.html#to-create-missing-ledger-entries-to-match-bank-statement-lines-with">To create missing ledger entries to match bank transactions with</a>.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A transaction in the internal bank account corresponds to a bank transaction but some information is too different to give a match.</td>
<td>Information, such as the amount or the customer name, was entered differently in connection with the bank transaction or the internal posting.</td>
<td>Review the information, and then manually match the two. Optionally, correct the information mismatch.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You must resolve the differences, for example by creating missing entries and correcting non-matching information, or by making missing money transactions, until the bank account reconciliation is completed and posted.</p>
<p>You can fill in the <strong>Bank Statement Lines</strong> pane on the <strong>Bank Acc. Reconciliation</strong> page in the following ways:</p>
