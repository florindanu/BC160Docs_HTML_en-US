<h1 id="application-compliance">Application Compliance</h1>

Confidence in a business management solution is key to running an efficient business. With Business Central companies are empowered to streamline business processes while consistently and cost-efficiently complying with increasing regulation and reporting requirements.</p>
<h2 id="data-privacy">Data Privacy</h2>
<p>Business Central supports data privacy initiatives like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that went into effect on May 25th 2018. Read more about how <a href="../admin-responding-to-requests-about-personal-data.html">Business Central supports GDPR</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a developer for Business Central extensions you must know about classifying data. Please see <a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-classifying-data">this page</a>.
If you want to learn more about GDPR from a broader Dynamics 365 perspective, please see <a href="http://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/get-started/gdpr/">this list of whitepapers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="accounting-processes-and-controls-to-aid-compliance">Accounting processes and controls to aid compliance</h2>
<p>Companies face increasing financial accounting challenges each year. Depending on industry, markets, geographic location, and financing needs, an organization may be subject to local generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and one or more of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), a U.S. law passed in 2002 to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures.</li>
<li>The International Financial Reporting Standards section of the European Union’s International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRS), which went into effect in 2005 and sets forth international accounting standards for recognition, measurement, consolidation, and reporting.</li>
<li>The New Basel Accord (Basel II), enacted in 2006 to address issues of financial institution risk and to promote greater stability in the overall financial system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="good-practices-with-technology">Good practices with technology</h2>
<p>Compliance depends not only on accurate information and appropriate accounting processes, but also on the people who set up and administer those processes.

<p>Microsoft is building localized versions of Business Central for some countries. These localizations primarily focus on regulatory features in the tax and financial area but can sometimes involve other parts of the application. If you want to see what is built in localized country versions of Business Central, see <strong>Local Functionality</strong> in the menu and choose a country to learn about country specific functionality.</p>

<p><strong>Sarbanes-Oxley: Validating Data and Processes</strong><br>
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act establishes standards for all U.S. public company boards, management, and public accounting firms, including evaluation and disclosure	of	the	adequacy	of	the	company’s	internal	controls over financial reporting. Documenting and testing critical manual and automated controls represents a huge commitment of time and resources for companies. Business Central is especially suited for subsidiaries of larger organizations, and can help support small to midsized businesses in complying with Sarbanes-Oxley.</p>

<h5>Note</h5>
<p><strong>IAS/IFRS: Recognition and Measurement Standards</strong><br>
Depending on the local GAAPs currently in use, one of the major recognition and measurement changes for IAS/IFRS is extended use of fair-value principles instead of historical cost. Business Central can help companies calculate fair-value and net present value (NPV) concepts, which are focused on current and expected cash flow streams rather than historical purchase price. On the reporting side, it can provide segment reporting by business unit and geographical location.</p>

<p><strong>Basel II: Implications for Reporting and Analysis</strong><br>
Basel II, developed by the Bank for International Settlements, helps ensure safety and security in the financial system in three key areas: minimum capital requirements, supervisory review process, and market discipline. Although the accord applies to financial institutions and does not target small and mid-sized businesses, Basel II may have some implications for these organizations in reporting  and analysis.</p>
