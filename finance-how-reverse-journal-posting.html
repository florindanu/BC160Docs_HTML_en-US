<h1 id="reverse-journal-postings-and-undo-receiptsshipments">Reverse Journal Postings and Undo Receipts/Shipments</h1>

<p>To undo an erroneous journal posting, you select the entry and create a reverse entry (entries identical to the original entry but with opposite sign in the amount field) with the same document number and posting date as the original entry. After reversing an entry, you must make the correct entry.</p>
<p>You can only reverse entries that are posted from a general journal line. An entry can only be reversed once.</p>
<p>To undo a receipt or shipment posting, before they are posted as invoiced, you can use the <strong>Undo</strong> function on the posted document. You can undo quantities of type <strong>Item</strong> and <strong>Resource</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have made an incorrect negative quantity posting, such as a purchase order with the wrong number of items, and posted it as received but not invoiced, then you can undo the posting.</p>
<p>If you have made an incorrect positive quantity posting, such as a sales shipment or a purchase return shipment with the wrong number of items, and posted it as shipped but not invoiced, then you can undo the posting.</p>
