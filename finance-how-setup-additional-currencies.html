<h1 id="set-up-an-additional-reporting-currency">Set Up an Additional Reporting Currency</h1>

<p>As companies operate in increasingly more countries/regions, it becomes more important that they are able to review and report financial data in more than one currency.</p>
<p>Your general ledger is set up to use your local currency (LCY), but you can set it up to also use another currency with a current exchange rate assigned. By designating a second currency as a so-called additional reporting currency, Business Central will automatically record amounts in both LCY and this additional reporting currency on each G/L entry and other entries, such as VAT entries.</p>
<div class="WARNING">
<h5>Warning</h5>
<p>The Additional Reporting Currency functionality should not be used as a basis for financial statement translation. It is not a tool that can perform translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements as part of a company consolidation. The additional reporting currency can only be used to prepare reports in another currency, as if that currency was the company’s local currency.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="displaying-reports-and-amounts-in-the-additional-reporting-currency">Displaying Reports and Amounts in the Additional Reporting Currency</h2>
<p>Using an additional reporting currency can assist the reporting process for a company in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies in non-EU countries/regions that have a high proportion of transactions with EU country/region companies. In this case, the non-EU company may also wish to report in euro to make its financial reports more usable for EU trade partners.</li>
<li>Companies that also wish to display reports in a more internationally traded currency than their own local currency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several financial reports are based on G/L entries. To display report data in the additional reporting currency, you simply place a check mark in the <strong>Show Amounts in Add. Reporting Currency</strong> field on the <strong>Options</strong> FastTab for the relevant G/L report.</p>
<h2 id="adjusting-exchange-rates">Adjusting Exchange Rates</h2>
<p>Because exchange rates fluctuate constantly, additional currency equivalents in your system must be adjusted periodically. If these adjustments are not done, amounts that have been converted from foreign (or additional) currencies and posted to the general ledger in LCY may be misleading. In addition, daily entries posted before a daily exchange rate is entered into application must be updated after the daily exchange rate information is entered. The <strong>Adjust Exchange Rates</strong> batch job is used to adjust the exchange rates of posted customer, vendor and bank account entries. It can also update additional reporting currency amounts on G/L entries. For more information, see <a href="finance-how-update-currencies.html">Update Currency Exchange Rates</a>.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-an-additional-reporting-currency">Setting Up an Additional Reporting Currency</h2>
<p>To set up an additional reporting currency, you must follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specify general ledger accounts for posting exchange rate adjustments.</li>
<li>Specify the exchange rate adjustment method for all general ledger accounts.</li>
<li>Specify the exchange rate adjustment method for VAT entries.</li>
<li>Activate the additional reporting currency.</li>

<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Residual amounts can occur when Business Central rounds debit and credit amounts that have been converted from LCY to an additional reporting currency.</p>
</div>
<p>For each general ledger account, you must specify how general ledger amounts for that account will be adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations between LCY and the additional reporting currency.</p>

</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>GL Account Card</strong> page, select the relevant method in the <strong>Exchange Rate Adjustment</strong> field.</p>
<p>If you post in an additional reporting currency, specify in the <strong>Exchange Rate Adjustment</strong> field how this general ledger account will be adjusted for exchange-rate fluctuations between LCY and the additional reporting currency. The following table shows the options to choose from.</p>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>No Adjustment</strong></td>
<td>No exchange rate adjustment is made to the general ledger account. This is the default option.<br><br> <strong>NOTE:</strong> This option should be selected if the exchange rate between the LCY and additional reporting currency is always fixed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Adjust Amount</strong></td>
<td>The LCY amount is adjusted for any exchange rate gains or losses. Exchange rate gains or losses are posted to the general ledger account in the <strong>Amount</strong> field and to the accounts you specified for gains or losses in the <strong>Realized G/L Gains Account</strong> and <strong>Realized G/L Losses Account</strong> fields on the <strong>Currencies</strong> page.</td>

<p>Exchange rate gains and losses are posted when you run the <strong>Adjust Exchange Rates</strong> batch job. In that batch job, the adjustment exchange rate is identified on the <strong>Currency Exchange Rates</strong> page, and then the amounts in the <strong>Amount</strong> and <strong>Additional-Currency Amount</strong> fields on the general ledger entry are compared to determine whether there is an exchange rate gain or loss. The batch job uses the option that you select in the <strong>Exchange Rate Adjustment</strong> field to determine how to calculate and post exchange rate gains or losses for general ledger accounts.</p>

<p>When you run the <strong>Adjust Exchange Rates</strong> batch job, the adjustment exchange rate is identified on the <strong>Currency Exchange Rate</strong> page and then the amounts in the <strong>Amount</strong> and <strong>Additional-Currency Amount</strong> fields on the VAT entry are compared to determine if there is an exchange rate gain or loss. The batch job uses the option that you select in this field to determine how to post exchange rate gains or losses for VAT accounts.</p>

<li><p>Choose the <strong>Yes</strong> button to confirm that you want to activate the currency.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>Adjust Add. Reporting Currency</strong> batch job opens.</p>
<p>This batch job converts LCY amounts on existing entries to the additional reporting currency. The batch job uses a default exchange rate copied from the exchange rate that is valid on the work date on the <strong>Currency Exchange Rates</strong> page. Residual amounts that occur on conversion of LCY to additional reporting currency are posted to the residual gains and losses accounts specified on the <strong>Currencies</strong> page. The posting date and document number for these entries are the same as for the original general ledger entry. After all these residual entries are posted, the batch job posts a rounding entry on the closing date of each closed year to the retained earnings account. This is to make sure that the ending balance of the income accounts for each closed years is 0 in both LCY and the additional reporting currency.</p>

<li><p>Fill in the fields as necessary. Hover over a field to read a short description.</p>

<li><p>Choose the <strong>OK</strong> button to run the batch job.</p>
</li>

<p>After running the batch job, amounts on the following existing entries will be in both LCY and in the additional reporting currency:</p>
<ul>
<li>General ledger entries</li>
<li>Item application entries</li>
<li>VAT entries</li>
<li>Job ledger entries</li>
<li>Value entries</li>
<li>Production order lines</li>
