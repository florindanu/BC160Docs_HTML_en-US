<p>You can see where an item-tracked item was used, including how and when it was received or produced, transferred, sold, consumed, or returned. You can also find all current instances of a specific serial or lot number in the database. You do this by using the Item Tracing and the Navigate features.</p>
<p>These features can be particularly useful in quality control when you need to find out which customers received products with a particular lot number or when you need to find out which lot a defective component came from.</p>
<p>On the <strong>Item Tracing</strong> page, you can trace forwards and backwards in a sequence of posted inventory transactions for the serial or lot number.</p>
<p>On the <strong>Navigate</strong> page, you cannot see the sequence of transactions, but you can see all records of the serial or lot number, both posted entries and open records.</p>
<p>The two features can be used in combination by transferring a traced serial or lot number to the <strong>Navigate</strong> page to finish a complete trace scenario. For more information, see <a href="walkthrough-tracing-serial-lot-numbers.html">Walkthrough: Tracing Serial-Lot Numbers</a>.</p>

<td>This method traces the item starting from where it came into inventory to where it was used.

<p>If additional transaction history under an item tracing line has already been traced by another line above it, then the <strong>Already Traced</strong> check box is selected. To provide a simpler view, such underlying lines are not shown.</p>
<p>To find the item tracing lines where the transaction history has already been traced, choose the <strong>Go to Already Traced</strong> button. The item tracing line in question is selected, and all underlying lines are expanded.</p>
