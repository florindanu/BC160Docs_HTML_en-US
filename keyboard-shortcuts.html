<h1 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</h1>

<p>This article provides an overview of some of the shortcut key combinations that you can use when you're working with Business Central.</p>
<p>For an overview of the most popular keyboard shortcuts, see <a href="keyboard-shortcuts-cheatsheet.html">Keyboard Shortcuts (PC only)</a>.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>For a graphical view of the most used shortcuts, choose the following image and download the PDF file.</p>
<p><a href="media/keyboard_shortcuts.pdf"> <img src="media/keyboard_shortcut_inline.png" alt=""> </a></p>
</div>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts aid accessibility and can make it easier and more efficient to navigate to different areas and elements on a page. They're supported by most web browsers, however, the behavior may vary slightly.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The keyboard shortcuts described here refer to the U.S. keyboard layout. The layout of the keys on other keyboards may not correspond exactly to the keys on a U.S. keyboard.</p>
</div>
<p>Most of the shortcuts are the same whether the operating system is Windows or macOS. However, some shortcuts differ for macOS. These shortcuts are indicated with brackets in the following sections.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>In addition to the global keyboard shortcuts described in this topic, a number of business-specific shortcuts are available. For example, in the generic version of Business Central, F9 posts a document and Ctrl+F7 shows the financial entries for a record. (These may be different in you solution.) The keyboard shortcut is shown in the tooltip for the action in question.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Keyboard"> General Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>The following table describes keyboard shortcuts for navigating and accessing different elements of a page. Elements include things like actions, drop-down lists, lookups, and more. For details about keyboard shortcuts for navigating records once you get inside a list, see the next section.</p>

<h2 id="keyboard-shortcuts-in-lists">Keyboard Shortcuts in Lists</h2>
<p>The following table describes the keyboard shortcuts that you can use on a list page. The shortcut action is slightly different depending on whether the page is shown in the list view or tile view.</p>
<!--
> [!Note]
> In the table that follows, the term *actionable field* refers to a field on which you can do something, like change a value or link to another page. In general, the shortcuts will skip over fields that display information that you cannot change from the list (in other words, fields that are read-only).
