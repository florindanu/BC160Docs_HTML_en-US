<h1 id="set-up-jobs">Set Up Jobs</h1>

<p>As a project manager, you can set up jobs that define each of the projects that you manage in Business Central. On the <strong>Jobs Setup</strong> page, you must specify how you want to use certain job features.</p>
<p>For each job, you then specify individual job cards with information about prices for job items, job resources, and job G/L accounts, and you must set up job posting groups.</p>
<h2 id="to-set-general-information-for-jobs">To set general information for jobs</h2>
<ol>
<li>Choose the <img src="media/ui-search/search_small.png" alt="Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature" title="Tell me what you want to do"> icon, enter <strong>Jobs Setup</strong>, and then choose the related link.</li>
<li>Fill in the fields as necessary. Hover over a field to read a short description.</li>
</ol>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The impact of the <strong>Apply Usage Link by Default</strong> field is rather complex and is therefore explained in the following section.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="to-set-up-job-usage-tracking">To set up job usage tracking</h3>
<p>When you are executing a job, you might want to know how your usage is tracking against your plan. To easily do this, you can create a link between your job planning lines and the actual usage. This lets you track your costs and to easily see at how much work remains to be done. By default, the job planning line type is <strong>Budget</strong>, but using the line type <strong>Both Budget and Billable</strong> has similar effects.</p>
<p>If you select the <strong>Apply Usage Link by Default</strong> field, then you can review information on the job planning line. You can set the quantity of the resource, item, or general ledger account and then indicate what quantity you want to transfer to the job journal. The <strong>Remaining Quantity</strong> field on the job planning line will tell you what remains to be transferred and posted to the job journal.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>You can enable or disable job usage tracking for a specific job. The value of the <strong>Apply Usage Link</strong> field on the individual job card overrides the setting in the <strong>Jobs Setup</strong> page.</p>
</div>
<p>When the <strong>Apply Usage Link by Default</strong> check box is selected, and the job planning line type is <strong>Billable</strong>, a job planning line of type <strong>Budget</strong> is created after you post a job journal line.</p>
<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>If job usage tracking is enabled, either in the <strong>Jobs Setup</strong> page or on the individual job, and the <strong>Line Type</strong> field on the job journal line is blank, then new job planning lines of line type <strong>Budget</strong> are created when you post job journal lines.</p>
<p>If job usage tracking is <em>not</em> enabled, either in the <strong>Jobs Setup</strong> page or on the individual job, and the <strong>Line Type</strong> field on the job journal line is blank, then no job planning lines are created when you post job journal lines. For more information, see <a href="projects-how-record-job-usage.html">Record Usage for Jobs</a>.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Choose the <img src="media/ui-search/search_small.png" alt="Search for Page or Report" title="Search for Page or Report icon"> icon, enter <strong>Jobs Setup</strong>, and then choose the related link.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Apply Usage Link by Default</strong> check box.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="to-set-up-prices-for-job-resources">To set up prices for job resources</h2>
<p>You can set up specific prices for resources for a job. You use the <strong>Job Resource Prices</strong> page to do this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the <img src="media/ui-search/search_small.png" alt="Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature" title="Tell me what you want to do"> icon, enter <strong>Jobs</strong>, and then choose the related link.</li>
<li>Select the relevant job, and then choose the <strong>Resource</strong> action.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Job Resource Prices</strong> page, fill in the fields as necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The optional information in the <strong>Job Task No.</strong>, <strong>Work Type</strong>, <strong>Currency Code</strong>, <strong>Line Discount %</strong>, and <strong>Unit Cost Factor</strong> fields will be used on the job planning lines and usage journals when this resource is entered and added to the job.</p>
<p>The value in the <strong>Unit Price</strong> field for the resource will be used on the job planning lines and job journals when this resource, a resource assigned to the resource group, or any resource is entered.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>This price will always override any prices set up in the existing <strong>Resource Price/Resource Group Prices</strong> page.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="to-set-up-prices-for-job-items">To set up prices for job items</h2>
<p>You can set up specific prices for items for a job. You use the <strong>Job Item Prices</strong> page to do this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the <img src="media/ui-search/search_small.png" alt="Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature" title="Tell me what you want to do"> icon, enter <strong>Jobs</strong>, and then choose the related link.</li>
<li>Select the relevant job, and then choose the <strong>Item</strong> action.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Job Item Prices</strong> page, fill in the fields as necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The optional information in the <strong>Job Task No.</strong>, <strong>Currency Code</strong>, and <strong>Line Discount %</strong> fields will be used in the job planning lines and job journals when this item is entered or added to the job.</p>
<p>The value in the <strong>Unit Price</strong> field for the item will be used on the job planning lines and job journals when this item is entered.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>This price will always override the regular customer price (the “best price” mechanism) for items. If you want to use the regular customer price mechanisms, then you should not create any job item prices for the job.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="to-set-up-prices-for-job-general-ledger-accounts">To set up prices for job general ledger accounts</h2>
<p>You can set up specific prices for general ledger expenses for a job. You use the <strong>Job G/L Account Prices</strong> page to do this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the <img src="media/ui-search/search_small.png" alt="Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature" title="Tell me what you want to do"> icon, enter <strong>Jobs</strong>, and then choose the related link.</li>
<li>Select the relevant job, and then choose the <strong>G/L Account</strong> action.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Job G/L Account Prices</strong> page, fill in the fields as necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The optional information in the <strong>Job Task No.</strong>, <strong>Currency Code</strong>, <strong>Line Discount %</strong>, <strong>Unit Cost Factor</strong>, and <strong>Unit Cost</strong> fields will be used on the job planning lines and job journals when this general ledger account is entered and added to a job.</p>
<p>The value in the <strong>Unit Price</strong> field for the general ledger job expense will be used on the job planning lines and job journals when this general ledger account is entered.</p>
<h2 id="to-set-up-job-posting-groups">To set up job posting groups</h2>
<p>One aspect of planning jobs is deciding which posting accounts to use for job costing. To be able to post jobs, you set up accounts for posting for each job posting group. A posting group represents a link between the job and how it should be treated in the general ledger. When you create a job, you specify a posting group, and by default, each task you create for the job is associated with that posting group. However, as you create tasks, you can override the default and select a posting group that is more appropriate.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The necessary accounts in the chart of accounts must be set up before you set up posting groups. For more information, see <a href="finance-setup-chart-accounts.html">Set Up or Change the Chart of Accounts</a>.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Choose the <img src="media/ui-search/search_small.png" alt="Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature" title="Tell me what you want to do"> icon, enter <strong>Job Posting Groups</strong>, and then choose the related link.</li>
<li>Choose the <strong>New</strong> action, and then fill in the account fields as described in the following table.</li>
