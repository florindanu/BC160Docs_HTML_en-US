<p>Managing receivables includes checking whether amounts due are paid on time. If customers have overdue payments, you can begin by sending the Customer Statement report as a reminder. Alternatively, you can issue reminders.</p>
<p>You can use reminders to remind customers about overdue amounts. You can also use reminders to calculate finance charges, such as interest or fees and include them on the reminder. Use finance charge memos if you want to debit customers for interest or fees without reminding them of overdue amounts.</p>
<h2 id="reminders">Reminders</h2>
<p>Before you can create reminders, you must set up reminder terms and assign them to your customers. Each reminder term has predefined reminder levels. Each reminder level includes rules about when the reminder will be issued, for example, how many days after the invoice due date or the date of the previous reminder. The contents of the <strong>Finance Charge Terms</strong> page determines whether interest is calculated on the reminder.</p>
<p>You can periodically run the <strong>Create Reminders</strong> batch job to create reminders for all customers with overdue balances, or you can manually create a reminder for a specific customer and have the lines calculated and filled in automatically.</p>
<p>After you create the reminders, you can modify them. The text that appears at the beginning and end of a reminder is determined by the reminder level terms, and can be seen in the <strong>Description</strong> column. If a calculated amount has been inserted automatically in the beginning or ending text, the text will not be adjusted if you delete lines. Then you must use the <strong>Update Reminder Text</strong> function.</p>
<p>A customer ledger entry with the <strong>On Hold</strong> field filled in will not prompt the creation of a reminder. However, if a reminder is created on the basis of another entry, an overdue entry marked on hold will also be included on the reminder. Interest is not calculated on lines with these entries.</p>
<p>After you have created reminders and made any needed modifications, you can either print test reports or issue the reminders, typically as email.</p>
<h2 id="finance-charges">Finance Charges</h2>
<p>When a customer does not pay by the due date, you can have finance charges calculated automatically and add them to the overdue amounts on the customer's account. You can inform customers of the added charges by sending finance charge memos.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>You use finance charge memos to calculate interest and finance charges and to inform your customers about interest and finance charges without reminding them of overdue payments. Alternatively, you can calculate interest on overdue payments when you create reminders.</p>
</div>
<p>You can manually create a finance charge memo for an individual customer, and fill in the lines automatically. Alternatively, you can use the <strong>Create Finance Charge Memos</strong> function job to create finance charge memos for all or selected customers with overdue balances.</p>
<p>After you create the finance charge memos, you can modify them. The text that appears at the beginning and end of the finance charge memo is determined by the finance charge terms, and can be seen in the <strong>Description</strong> column on the lines. If a calculated amount has been inserted automatically in the beginning or ending text, the text will not be adjusted if you delete lines. Then you must use the <strong>Update Finance Charge Text</strong> function.</p>
<p>After you have created finance charge memos and made any needed modifications, you can either print test reports or issue the finance charge memos, typically as email.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-interest-rates">Multiple Interest rates</h2>
<p>When you set up finance charge terms and reminder terms, for delayed payment penalty, you can specify multiple interest rates so that the penalty fee is calculated from different interest rates in different periods. If multiple interest rates are not set up, then the interest rate and period that is defined in the <strong>Finance Charge Terms</strong> and <strong>Reminder Terms</strong> pages for the whole period of calculation will be used. For more information, see <a href="finance-how-to-set-up-multiple-interest-rates.html">Set Up Multiple Interest Rates</a>.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="to-set-up-reminder-terms">To set up reminder terms</h2>
<p>If customers have overdue payments, you must decide when and how to send them a reminder. In addition, you may want to debit their accounts for interest or fees. You can set up any number of reminder terms. For each reminder terms code, you can define an unlimited number of reminder levels.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the <img src="media/ui-search/search_small.png" alt="Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature" title="Tell me what you want to do"> icon, enter <strong>Reminder Terms</strong>, and then choose the related link.</li>

</ol>
<h2 id="to-set-up-reminder-levels">To set up reminder levels</h2>
<p>The first time a reminder is created for a customer, the setting from level 1 is used. When the reminder is issued, the level number is registered on the reminder entries that are created and linked to the individual customer ledger entries. If it is necessary to remind the customer again, all reminder entries linked to open customer ledger entries are checked to locate the highest level number. The conditions from the next level number will then be used for the new reminder.</p>
<p>If you create more reminders than you have defined levels for, the conditions for the highest level will be used. You can create as many reminders as are allowed by the <strong>Max. No of Reminders</strong> field in the reminder terms.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose the <img src="media/ui-search/search_small.png" alt="Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature" title="Tell me what you want to do"> icon, enter <strong>Reminder Terms</strong>, and then choose the related link.</p>

<li><p>Choose the <strong>Currencies</strong> action.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Currencies for Reminder Levels</strong> page, define for each reminder level code and corresponding reminder level number a currency code and an additional fee.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>When you create reminders in a foreign currency, the foreign currency conditions that you set up here will be used to create reminders. If there are no foreign currency reminder conditions set up, the LCY reminder conditions that are set up on the <strong>Reminder Levels</strong> page will be used and then converted to the relevant currency.</p>
</div>
<p>For each reminder level, you can specify text that will be printed before (<strong>Beginning Text</strong>) or after (<strong>Ending Text</strong>) on the entries on the reminder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose the <strong>Beginning Text</strong> or <strong>Ending Text</strong> actions respectively, and fill on the <strong>Reminder Text</strong> page.</p>

<h2 id="to-issue-a-reminder">To issue a reminder</h2>
<p>After you have created reminders and made any needed modifications, you can either print test reports or issue the reminders.</p>
<p>When you issue a reminder, the data is transferred to a separate page for issued reminders. At the same time, reminder entries are posted. If interest or an additional fee has been calculated, entries are posted to the customer ledger and the general ledger.</p>
<p>When a reminder is issued, the entries are posted according to your specifications on the <strong>Reminder Terms</strong> page. This specification determines whether interest and/or additional fees are posted to the customer's account and the general ledger. Setup on the <strong>Customer Posting Groups</strong> page determines which accounts are posted to.</p>
<p>For each customer ledger entry on the finance charge memo, an entry is created on the <strong>Reminder/Fin. Charge Entries</strong> page.</p>
<p>If the <strong>Post Interest</strong> or the <strong>Post Additional Fee</strong> check boxes are selected on the <strong>Reminder Terms</strong> page, then the following entries are also created:</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="to-set-up-finance-charge-terms">To set up finance charge terms</h2>
<p>You must set up a code representing each finance charge calculation. Then you can enter this code in the <strong>Fin. Charge Terms Code</strong> field on customer or vendor cards.</p>
<p>Finance charges can be calculated using either the average daily balance method or the balance due method.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Balance due method</p>
<p>The finance charge is simply a percentage of the overdue amount:<br>
<em>Balance Due method</em> - <em>Finance Charge</em> = <em>Overdue Amount</em> x <em>(Interest Rate / 100)</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Average daily balance method</p>
<p>The number of days the payment is overdue is taken into account:<br>
<em>Average Daily Balance method</em> - <em>Finance Charge</em> = <em>Overdue Amount</em> x <em>(Days Overdue / Interest Period)</em> x <em>(Interest Rate/100)</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, each code in the Finance Charge Terms table is linked to a subtable, the Finance Charge Text table. For each set of finance charge terms, you can define a beginning and/or an ending text to be included on the finance charge memo.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose the <img src="media/ui-search/search_small.png" alt="Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature" title="Tell me what you want to do"> icon, enter <strong>Finance Charge Terms</strong>, and then choose the related link.</p>
