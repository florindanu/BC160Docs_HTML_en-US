<h1 id="reconcile-customer-payments-with-the-cash-receipt-journal-or-from-customer-ledger-entries">Reconcile Customer Payments with the Cash Receipt Journal or from Customer Ledger Entries</h1>

<p>When you receive a cash receipt from a customer, or you make a cash refund, you must decide whether to apply the payment or refund to close one or more open debit or credit entries. You can specify the amount you want to apply. For example, you can apply partial payments to customer ledger entries. Closing customer ledger entries makes sure that information such as customer statistics, account statements, and finance charges are correct.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>On the <strong>Customer Ledger Entries</strong> page, red font means that the related payment is past its due date. If overdue payments are becoming a problem, we can help you reduce their frequency. You can enable the <strong>Late Payment Predictions</strong> extension, which uses a predictive model that we built in Azure Machine Learning to predict the timing of payments. These predictions help you reduce outstanding receivables and fine-tune your collections strategy. For example, if a payment is predicted to be late, you can adjust the terms of payment or the payment method for the customer. For more information, see <a href="ui-extensions-late-payment-prediction.html">Late Payment Predictions</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>You can apply customer ledger entries in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>By entering information on dedicated pages:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Payment Reconciliation Journal</strong> page. For more information, see <a href="receivables-apply-payments-auto-reconcile-bank-accounts.html">Applying Payments Automatically and Reconciling Bank Accounts</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Payment Registration</strong> page. For more information, see <a href="receivables-how-reconcile-customer-payments-list-unpaid-sales-documents.html">Reconcile Customer Payments from a List of Unpaid Sales Documents</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>Cash Reciept Journal</strong>. This is described below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By filling in the <strong>Applies-to Doc. No.</strong> field on sales credit memo documents. This is described below.</li>
<li>By using the <strong>Set Applies-to ID</strong> action on a customer ledger entry. This is described below.</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>If the <strong>Application Method</strong> field on the customer card contains <strong>Apply to Oldest</strong>, payments are applied to the oldest open credit entry, unless you manually specify an entry. If the application method is <strong>Manual</strong>, you always apply entries manually.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="to-fill-and-post-a-cash-receipt-journal">To fill and post a cash receipt journal</h2>
<p>A cash receipt journal is a type of general journal, so you can use it to post transactions to general ledger, bank, customer, vendor, and fixed assets accounts. You can apply the payment to one or more debit entries when you post the payment, or you can apply from the posted entries later.</p>

<p>If you sell to a customer in one currency and receive payment in another currency, you can still apply the invoice to the payment.</p>
<p>If you apply an entry (Entry 1) in one currency to an entry (Entry 2) in a different currency, the posting date on Entry 1 is used to find the relevant exchange rate to convert amounts on Entry 2. The relevant exchange rate is found on the <strong>Currency Exchange Rates</strong> page.</p>
<p>Applying customer ledger entries in different currencies must be enabled. For more information, see <a href="finance-how-enable-application-ledger-entries-different-currencies.html">Enable Application of Ledger Entries in Different Currencies</a>.</p>

<div class="IMPORTANT">
<h5>Important</h5>
<p>When you apply entries in different currencies, the entries are converted to USD. Although the exchange rates for the two currencies are fixed, for example between USD and EUR, there may be a small residual amount when they are converted to USD. These small residual amounts are posted as gains and losses to the account specified in the <strong>Realized Gains Account</strong> or <strong>Realized Losses Account</strong> fields on the <strong>Currencies</strong> page. The <strong>Amount (USD)</strong> field is also adjusted on the vendor ledger entries.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="to-correct-an-application-of-customer-entries">To correct an application of customer entries</h2>
<p>When you correct an application, correcting entries that are identical to the original entry but with opposite sign in the amount field are created and posted for all entries, including all general ledger posting derived from the application, such as payment discount and currency gains/losses. The entries that were closed by the application are reopened.</p>
