<h1 id="work-with-blanket-sales-orders">Work with Blanket Sales Orders</h1>

<p>A blanket sales order represents a framework for a long-term agreement between you and your customer.</p>
<p>A blanket order is typically made when a customer has committed to purchasing large quantities that are to be delivered in several smaller shipments over a certain period of time. Often blanket orders cover only one item with predetermined delivery dates. The main reason for using a blanket order rather than a sales order is that quantities entered on a blanket order do not affect item availability and thus can be used as a worksheet for monitoring, forecasting, and planning purposes.</p>
<p>On the blanket order, each separate shipment can be set up as an order line, which can then be converted into a sales order at the time of shipping.</p>
<p>An example of when a blanket sales order could be used is if a customer calls and places an order of 1000 units of an item and they want the items to be delivered in 250 units every week over the next month.</p>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Blanket purchase orders work in a similar way as blanket sales orders. This documentation covers blanket sales orders only.</p>

<h2 id="to-create-a-blanket-sales-order">To create a blanket sales order</h2>
<ol>
<li>Choose the <img src="media/ui-search/search_small.png" alt="Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature" title="Tell me what you want to do"> icon, enter <strong>Blanket Sales Orders</strong>, and then choose the related link.</li>
<li>Choose the <strong>New</strong> action.</li>
<li>Fill in the fields as necessary. Hover over a field to read a short description.</li>
<li>Leave the <strong>Order Date</strong> field blank. When the separate sales orders are created from the blanket order, the order date of the sales order is set to equal the actual work date.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Lines</strong> FastTab, create separate lines for each shipment. For instance, if your customer wants 1000 units split out equally between four weeks, you would enter four separate lines of 250 units each.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="to-create-a-sales-order-from-a-blanket-sales-order">To create a sales order from a blanket sales order</h2>
<ol>
<li>To create an order for any of the lines in the blanket sales order, remove the quantity in the <strong>Qty. to Ship</strong> field on all the lines that you do not wish to ship at this time.</li>
<li>When you are ready to create orders, choose the <strong>Make Order</strong> action, and then choose <strong>Yes</strong>. A message appears informing you that the blanket order has been assigned an order number. Note that the blanket order has not been deleted.</li>
<li>Choose the <strong>OK</strong> button.</li>
<li>To see the results of the preceding steps, choose the <strong>Line</strong> action, choose the <strong>Unposted Lines</strong> action, and then choose the <strong>Orders</strong> action.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Sales Lines</strong> page, select the appropriate sales order, choose the <strong>Line</strong> action, and then choose the <strong>Show Document</strong> action.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following applies to sales orders after they have been created from blanket sales orders:</p>
<ul>
<li>After the blanket order is converted into a sales order, the sales order contains all the lines from the blanket order. The lines where the quantity in the <strong>Qty. to Ship</strong> field was deleted appear, but with blank <strong>Quantity</strong> fields. You may choose to leave, edit, or delete the lines.</li>
<li>It is important to remember that the sales order line quantity must not exceed the quantity of the associated blanket order line. Otherwise, posting of the sales order will not be possible.</li>
<li>When the sales order is posted as shipped and/or invoiced, the <strong>Quantity Shipped</strong> and <strong>Quantity Invoiced</strong> fields are updated on the related blanket order.</li>
<li>The blanket order number and line number are recorded as properties of the sales lines when created from a blanket order.</li>
<li>When sales orders are not created directly from the blanket order but still relate to it, a link between a sales order and a blanket order can be established by entering the associated blanket order number in the <strong>Blanket Order No.</strong> field on the sales order line.</li>
<li>After the sales order has been created for the total quantity of a blanket order line, no other sales order can be created for the same line. Users are prevented from entering a quantity in the <strong>Qty. to Ship</strong> field. If, however, additional quantities need to be added to a blanket order, the value in the <strong>Quantity</strong> field can be increased and additional orders can then be created.</li>
<li>The invoiced blanket sales order remains in the system until it is deleted, either by deleting individual blanket orders or by running the <strong>Delete Invoiced Blanket Sales Orders</strong> batch job.</li>
<li>If a customer is also recorded as a contact in the Marketing application area, and if you have specified an interaction template code for blanket sales order on the <strong>Marketing Setup</strong> page, an interaction is recorded in the Interaction Log Entry table when you select <strong>Print</strong> to print the blanket sales order.</li>
</ul>
