On the <strong>Service Orders</strong> page, choose <strong>Statistics</strong>. The FastTabs in this page show information such as quantity, amount, VAT, cost, profit, and customer credit limit. The amounts on the page are in the currency of the service order, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<h3 id="view-totals-for-a-service-order">View totals for a service order</h3>

<p>For each entry type, you can see the invoiced amount, usage (amount), cost amount, quantity, quantity invoiced and quantity consumed, profit amount and profit percentage. The profit percentage is calculated according to the following formula:</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="using-trendscapes">Using Trendscapes</h2>
<p>For service items and service contracts, the <strong>Service Item Trendscape</strong> or <strong>Service Contract Trendscape</strong> pages provides a scrollable summary of service ledger entries in a period of time for a specific service item or contract. To view the trendscape, open the service item or service contract, choose the <strong>Statistics</strong> action, and then choose <strong>Trendscape</strong>.</p>
<p>When you scroll the list, the amounts are calculated in the local currency according to the specified time interval. All amounts are calculated from service ledger entries, which are entries that are created when you post service orders or service invoices.</p>
<p>You can filter the list by specifing the service items to include.</p>
<div class="TIP">
<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>If you have set the time interval to <strong>Day</strong> and you want to scroll over a long period, you can do it faster by shifting to a larger interval such as <strong>Quarter</strong>. When you have found the desired period, you can shift back to the original interval to see the data in more detail.</p>
