<p><strong>Note</strong>: This walkthrough must be performed on a demonstration company with the <strong>Full Evaluation - Complete Sample Data</strong> option, which is available in the Sandbox environment. For more information, see <a href="across-how-create-sandbox-environment.html">Creating a Sandbox Environment</a>.</p>
<p>This walkthrough introduces you to the project management features in jobs. Jobs are a way for you to schedule the usage of your company's resources and to keep track of the various costs associated with the resources on a specific project. Jobs involves the consumption of employee hours, machine hours, inventory items, and other types of usage that you may want to track as a job progresses.</p>
<p>This walkthrough covers the setup of a new job in addition to some common tasks such as handling fixed pricing, making payment by installments, posting invoices from jobs, and copying jobs.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-walkthrough">About This Walkthrough</h2>
<p>This walkthrough demonstrates the following tasks:</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-a-job">Setting Up a Job</h3>
<p>With the budget structure set up for jobs, creating a job is straightforward. This walkthrough covers the following procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up job task lines and planning lines.</li>
<li>Creating job-specific prices for items, resources, and general ledger accounts.</li>
<li>Invoicing from a job.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="handling-fixed-prices">Handling Fixed Prices</h3>
<p>In jobs, you can handle fixed prices and the prices for services or goods that are agreed upon in advance with customers. In this walkthrough, you can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>See how contract and invoice values are determined.</li>
<li>Allow for extra work in the schedule that has not been invoiced.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="copying-a-job">Copying a Job</h3>
<p>This part of the walkthrough focuses on how to copy part or all of a job in order to reduce manual data entry and improve accuracy. It includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying part of a job to a new job.</li>
<li>Copying job-specific prices.</li>
<li>Copying planning lines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="making-payment-by-installment">Making Payment by Installment</h3>
<p>When a large, expensive project lasts for a long period, the customer often makes an agreement with the company to pay by installments. This scenario shows how you set up payment by installments and covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating payment by installments for a job.</li>
<li>Invoicing payments to customers.</li>
<li>Accounting for usage in a job set up for payment by installments.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>
<p>This walkthrough includes tasks for the following roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Manager</li>
<li>Project Team Member</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Before you can perform the tasks in the walkthrough, you must do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the CRONUS International Ltd. demonstration database.</li>
<li>Create sample data by using the steps in the following section.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="story">Story</h2>
<p>This walkthrough focuses on CRONUS International Ltd., a design and consultancy firm that designs and fits new infrastructures, such as conference halls and offices, with furniture, accessories, and storage units. Most of its work is project oriented. Prakash is a project manager at CRONUS. He uses jobs to give him an overview of each ongoing job that CRONUS has started, as well as the jobs that are completed. He is usually the one who sets up deals with customers and enters the core of the job, which is task and planning lines in addition to prices, into Business Central. He finds that creating, maintaining, and reviewing information is straightforward. Prakash also likes the way Business Central enables copying jobs and payment by installments.</p>
<p>Tricia, a project team member who reports to Prakash, is responsible for monitoring the job day-to-day. She enters her own work in addition to the work performed by technicians on every task. She records the items that they have used and the costs that they have incurred.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-sample-data">Preparing Sample Data</h2>

<h2 id="calculating-remaining-usage">Calculating Remaining Usage</h2>
<p>Tricia, the team project member, has been working on the job for a while and wants to register her hours and usage on the job. She has not worked more hours than was agreed upon with the customer in advance. She uses the <strong>Calculate Remaining Usage</strong> batch job to calculate remaining usage for the job in a job journal. For each task, the batch job calculates the difference between scheduled usage of items, resources, and general ledger expenses and the actual usage posted in job ledger entries. The remaining usage is then displayed in the job journal from where she can post it.</p>
<h3 id="to-calculate-remaining-usage">To calculate remaining usage</h3>

<li>Enter today’s date as the posting date.</li>
<li>Choose the <strong>OK</strong> button. This will generate job journal lines derived from the planning lines that Prakash created for the job.</li>
<li>Choose the <strong>OK</strong> button on the confirmation page. The generated lines are added to the job journal.</li>
<li>Make sure that all the document numbers are J00001, and then choose the <strong>Post</strong> action. Choose <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm the posting.</li>
</ol>
<p>The lines are now posted.</p>
<h2 id="creating-and-posting-a-job-sales-invoice">Creating and Posting a Job Sales Invoice</h2>
<p>Next, Tricia can create a new invoice for the whole job or for part of a job. She can also attach the invoice to another invoice for the same customer for the same job. In this case, she invoices for the whole job, because the project is now completed.</p>

He has reached an agreement with the customer regarding fixed pricing for the job.</p>

<li><p>Select line 1120, and in the <strong>Schedule (Total Cost)</strong> field, right-click the amount and choose <strong>DrillDown</strong>.</p>
<p>By reviewing the Job Planning lines, Prakash determines that he will also need Tricia for 30 hours for this stage of the project. He agrees on a fixed price with the customer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Job Task Lines</strong> page, select line 1120, and then choose the <strong>Job Planning Lines</strong> action.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose the <strong>New</strong> to create a new line with the following information:</p>

<li><p>Close the page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Schedule (Total Cost)</strong> field, right-click the field, and choose <strong>Drilldown</strong> again on the <strong>Job Task Lines</strong> page. View the changes to the schedule. You see that 30 hours have been added to the schedule.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Close the pages.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After Tricia has been added to the schedule for this task line, she works 25 hours on the job. She enters these hours into the job journal.</p>

<li><strong>Job Task No.</strong>: <strong>1120</strong></li>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: <strong>Resource</strong></li>
<li><strong>No.</strong>: <strong>Tricia</strong></li>
<li><strong>Quantity</strong>: <strong>5</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>By using the <strong>Schedule</strong> line type, there are updates to the scheduled costs and prices, but no updates to the contract costs and prices that are invoiced to the customer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose the <strong>Post</strong> action. Choose the <strong>OK</strong> button to close the page.</p>

<p>In the total price for the contract, only the original contracted 30 hours are included, because this is what was agreed upon with the customer.</p>
<h2 id="copying-jobs">Copying Jobs</h2>
<p>Prakash has reached an agreement with a customer, Selagorian Ltd, to set up 10 conference rooms. The agreement resembles an earlier job. Therefore, it will save time to copy that earlier job.</p>
<p>On the <strong>Copy Job</strong> page, you can select the job and task lines that you want to copy. You can also select to copy the source job ledger entries, which creates planning lines based on actual usage, or you can copy the source job planning lines, which copies the original planning lines to the new job. You can then choose what planning line or ledger entry line type that you want to include, selecting only what is relevant to this new job. Finally, you can select the job that you want to copy to and define whether prices and quantities should be copied as well.</p>
