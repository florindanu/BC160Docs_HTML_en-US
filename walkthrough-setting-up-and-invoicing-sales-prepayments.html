<h1 id="walkthrough-setting-up-and-invoicing-sales-prepayments">Walkthrough: Setting Up and Invoicing Sales Prepayments</h1>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This walkthrough must be performed on a demonstration company with the <strong>Full Evaluation - Complete Sample Data</strong> option, which is available in the Sandbox environment. For more information, see <a href="across-how-create-sandbox-environment.html">Creating a Sandbox Environment</a>.</p>
<p>Prepayments are payments that are invoiced and posted to a sales or purchase prepayment order before final invoicing. You may require a deposit before you manufacture items to order, or you may require payment before you ship items to a customer. You use the prepayments functionality in Business Central to invoice and collect deposits that are required from customers or remit deposits to vendors. Thus, you can make sure that all payments are posted against an invoice.</p>
<p>Prepayment requirements can be defined for a customer or vendor for all items or selected items. After you complete the required setup, you can generate prepayment invoices from sales and purchase orders for the calculated prepayment amount. You can change the default amounts on the invoice as needed. For example, you can send additional prepayment invoices if additional items are added to the order.</p>
<h2 id="about-this-walkthrough">About This Walkthrough</h2>
<p>This walkthrough will take you through the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up prepayments</li>
<li>Creating an order that requires a prepayment</li>
<li>Creating a prepayment invoice</li>
<li>Correcting the prepayment requirements on an order</li>
<li>Applying prepayments to an order</li>
<li>Invoicing the final amount on an order with prepayment</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
<p>This walkthrough includes tasks for the following roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounting Manager (Phyllis)</li>
<li>Order Processor (Susan)</li>
<li>Accounts Receivable Administrator (Arnie)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="story">Story</h2>
<p>Phyllis is an accounting manager. She makes decisions about which customers are required to pay a deposit before items are manufactured or shipped. Phyllis sets up Business Central to calculate prepayments automatically.</p>
<p>Susan is a sales order processor. When a customer calls to place an order, she enters the order into the system while the customer is on the telephone. This way, she can verify prices and payment terms with the customer immediately, and she can make adjustments to the order while she negotiates with the customer.</p>
<p>Arnie works in the Accounts Receivable department, where he posts invoices and payments.</p>
<p>In this scenario, Phyllis sets up prepayment requirements for the customer Selangorian, based on their credit history, and gives Susan instructions for how to handle their orders.</p>
<p>When the customer calls, Susan negotiates with the customer until they reach an agreement. She can then choose to calculate the prepayment in several different ways.</p>
<p>After Susan sends the prepayment invoice, the customer orders an extra item. Susan updates the order and creates a second prepayment invoice.</p>
<p>Arnie registers the customer's payment and applies it to the invoices, and then sends the final invoice.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-prepayments">Setting Up Prepayments</h2>
<p>Phyllis sets up the system to handle prepayments for customers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Phyllis decides to have the same number series for prepayments as the one used for sales invoicing.</li>
<li>Phyllis sets application to check if prepayments are required before final invoicing on an order.</li>
<li>Phyllis sets up default values for a required prepayment percentage for particular items and customers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following procedures describe how to complete Phyllis' tasks:</p>
<h4 id="to-set-up-number-series-for-prepayments">To set up number series for prepayments</h4>
<ol>
<li>Choose the <img src="media/ui-search/search_small.png" alt="Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature" title="Tell me what you want to do"> icon, enter <strong>Sales &amp; Receivables Setup</strong>, and then choose the related link.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Sales &amp; Receivables Setup</strong> page, expand the <strong>Numbering</strong> FastTab.</li>
<li>Verify that the number series for posted prepayment invoices in the <strong>Posted Prepmt. Inv. Nos.</strong> field is the same as for posted sales invoices (<strong>Posted Invoice Nos.</strong>) and the number series for posted prepayment credit memos (<strong>Posted Prepmt. Cr. Memo Nos.</strong>) is the same as for posted credit memos (<strong>Posted Credit Memo Nos.</strong>).</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="to-block-shipments-for-unpaid-prepayment">To block shipments for unpaid prepayment</h4>
<ol>
<li><p>On the <strong>Sales &amp; Receivables Setup</strong> page, on the <strong>General</strong> FastTab, select the <strong>Check Prepayment when Posting</strong> check box.</p>
<p>Now you cannot ship or invoice an order that has an unpaid prepayment amount.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By default, Phyllis requires customer 20000 to be invoiced for a 30% down payment on all orders. Therefore, she will enter a default prepayment percentage on the customer card.</p>
<p>Phyllis requires all customers to be invoiced a 20% deposit for item 1100. Customer 20000 has a poor payment history. Therefore, she requires a 40% prepayment from customer 20000 for item 1100. The following procedure illustrates how to set up default prepayment percentages.</p>
<h4 id="to-assign-default-prepayment-percentages-to-customers-and-items">To assign default prepayment percentages to customers and items</h4>

<h2 id="creating-an-order-that-requires-a-prepayment">Creating an Order that Requires a Prepayment</h2>
<p>In the following scenario, Susan, the order processor, creates an order when talking to a customer. The items that the customer orders require a prepayment, and the customer has made some late payments in the past. Therefore, Susan has been instructed to require a fixed amount of 2,000 as a prepayment on the order.</p>
<p>The customer requests to be able to pay 35%, to which Susan can agree. Therefore, she changes the order.</p>
<p>Susan creates the prepayment invoice and sends it to the customer.</p>

<p>By default, the prepayment fields on the sales line are hidden, so you must display them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Verify that the <strong>Prepayment %</strong> field on the line with item <strong>1000</strong> contains <strong>30</strong>. The default value was taken from the sales header, which was populated from the customer card.</p>
<p>The <strong>Prepayment %</strong> field on the line with item <strong>1100</strong> contains <strong>40</strong>. This is the percentage you entered on the <strong>Sales Prepayment Percentages</strong> page for item <strong>1100</strong> and customer <strong>20000</strong>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Change the amount in the <strong>Prepmt. Line Amount Excl. VAT</strong> field to <strong>2000</strong> and then close the page.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Verify the <strong>Prepayment %</strong> field on the sales lines, and you will see that it has been recalculated to <strong>40.81625</strong>.</p>
<p>The recalculation includes all lines that have a prepayment percentage that is greater than 0.</p>
<p>Now the customer asks if the prepayment percent can be set to 35%. Susan's supervisor approves the change.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Sales Order</strong> page, in the <strong>Prepayment %</strong> field, enter <strong>35</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the warning that appears, choose the <strong>Yes</strong> button. A rate of 35% will be applied as the payment percentage for the whole order.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>This walkthrough has taken you through steps to set up Business Central to handle prepayments. You have set up default prepayment percentages on customers and items, and you have also used different methods to calculate the prepayments on an order. You have tried to assign one total prepayment amount to the order, and you have had the prepayment amount calculated as a percentage of the whole order.</p>
<p>You have also posted a prepayment invoice, created a second prepayment invoice when the order has changed, and posted the final invoice for the remaining amount.</p>
<p>The prepayments functionality in Business Central makes it easy to set up and enforce prepayment rules for customers and items, and it enables you to post every payment against an invoice.</p>
